## Start ->
    1. `make mongodata`
    2. `make`
    or see the Makefile and run the docker-compose commands manually

## Head over to
    1. `127.0.0.1:8199` Landing page or log in page [NOT PROTECTED]
    2. `127.0.0.1:8199/home` should be home after log in. [PROTECTED]
    3. `127.0.0.1:8199/api` will be our hidden api route. [ULTRA PROTECTED]

    We will build up the routes and views accordingly
